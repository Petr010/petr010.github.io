        <p class="content_p_main"> > Welcome to the PokéBoy project!  With the help of PCBWAY as the project sponsor, I developed a retropie project that would fit inside a standard store bought TCG Pokéball, because what else are you going to do with it?.</p> 
        <p class="content_p_main"> > This page will serve as a build guide if you ever wanted to make one, *I am not responsible for whatever outcome that might occur; like if you anger Arceus, that's not on me*</p>       
        <p class="content_p_main"> > Before we start, I highly recommend watching the full video on the PokéBoy below for a general overview of the build.  Also keep in mind that this isn't really the ideal console to play on, there are no LED indicator to tell you when it's low, and play time is low (2-3hrs) off the battery so it might need to stay plugged in.  If you did the display (advanced) step, the screen will start glitching out at low power so that in itself is a power indicator lol.  It is still a cool and fun build though, so have fun if you just like the novelty!</p>

Tape the ring to the top 3D printed part so that the ring and part is flush.  Reassemble the ball, and using the nut of the power button, gauge and mark an outline for the power button.

        <p class="content_p_main"> > The power button is simple whether you get a 4 leg or 5 leg button.  Two of the legs allow you to pass a connection when the button is pushed.  The other two are the positive and negative of the LED inside the button.  I recommend using some low valued resistor (about 250-500 Ohms) between the output of the button and the positive of the LED to restrict current draw.</p>

        <p class="content_p_main"> > If you are using a 5 legged button, it might be too long to fit without trimming the legs.  In this case it might be hard to fit the resistor.  It should be fine to wire "+"" and "NO" together without the resistor, but to ensure limited current, I recommend extending the "NO" wire and attach the resisotr between that and 5Vout.  You can also just short "NO and +" and add the resistor to the "-" line then to gnd on the raspberry Pi.  In both cases, use heat shrink tubing/electrical tape on the resistor to prevent shorts. </p>

        <p class="content_p_heading"> Closing Notes </p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > *FOR SAVE FILES* If you plan to play a game with a save file like pokemon, you need to save, then exit the game (press start and select at the same time) to save the file, it will not save if the ball powers down before exiting.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > I doubt anyone would read this far, but if you did, THANK YOU! This was an exciting opportunity given to be by PCBWAY, and I couldn't have asked for a better first project with them.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > There are plenty of things wrong with this project though, such as a better adhesive than epoxy would be nice.  I think using silicon between the ring and the top insert might be a good idea but it could be messy and am unsure how that would hold up.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > I think if you overclock the system it would yield better performance, but that might cause too much strain on the battery and a heatsink would be required... but the system is enclosed in a tin ball so I am unsure how effect that heat dissipation would be either way.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > I definitely would source a better battery, 2000mAh might not last long enough for the best gameplay (about 2-3hrs) and the ball can definitely fit a bigger battery.  Just make sure the voltages are compatible with the charinging module.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > There is also no real power indicator since I did not really have enough time to design that, but it's probablt possible.  If you did the "Display ADVANCE" step, the screen does start glitching out when the power gets low, so I suppose that can be used as a bad power indicator haha.</p>
        <p class="content_p_main"> > Other than that, this was a really fun project to do, and in a way, you can finally catch your own Pokémon in a Pokéball! haha</p>
